## JSMidi Examples: 10 Part Electronic

This is a simple 10 part electronic song using Logic Pro X software instruments
without any modifications made. See the instrument list below and the screenshot
for the levels I used. Also please read the documentation on
[multi track setup](https://github.com/aaronats/jsmidi/blob/master/docs/LOGIC.md#multitrack).
