## JSMidi Examples

Before you get started please be sure to read the
[JSMidi Documentation](https://github.com/aaronats/jsmidi) and follow the instructions
to get setup there. To play with the examples just clone this repository, navigate to
the example folder you would like to use and run `npm install`. Then open the project
in Atom, setup your project in Logic Pro X and you should be good to go.

#### Examples

1. [Amen Break Beat](amen/README.md)
2. [Multi Track Electronic](electronic/README.md)

#### Contributing

I would welcome any additional examples! Please publish your own projects and
shoot me a link. I will check them out and publish the links. Maybe one day JSMidi
will get its own Awesome JSMidi page!
